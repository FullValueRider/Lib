# Lib
 A twinBasic Library with useful classes for solving Advent Of Code problems.
 
 The sources directory contains
 * Individual source files
 * a xip of the source files
 * a zip of the twinbadic project file.

 CAVEAT:  I'm not a professional programmer so there will be some ugly/knarly stuff in the library.

 This library was started back in 2018 when it was just VBA in a Word template.

 In 2021 I transferred to twinBasic and started updating code to use some of the newer features which helped make life simpler.

 The classes I've developed have basically been a response to removing boilerplate code from VBA/TwinBasic e.g. the ,MapIt,FilterIt,ReduceIt functions of collection and key value pair classes.

 I've also developed a class (iteritems) that provides a richer environment for enumerating things (at the moment it will enumerate anything except multidimensionsal array, that will come shortly (shortly being a unit of time somewhere between 5 minutes and infinity)).

 A lot of the library is support infrastructure to make it easier to manage variants and simplify the code for the more obviously useful classes.

 The Library also contains lots of trials which I haven't completed or haven't had time to fully implement.

 The best way to see what can be one with the library, and how it transforms writing VBA/twinBasic, is to view the AoC2022 repository.

 Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or run into any problems.
